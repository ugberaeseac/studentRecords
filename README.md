## Setup & Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- MongoDB (running locally on `mongodb://localhost:27017`)
- Postman (for API testing)

---

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your_repo_url>
   cd studentRecords
   ```

2. **Install project dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start MongoDB**

   - On WSL/Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo service mongod start
     ```

   - Make sure MongoDB is accessible on `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. Click **Import** → Choose **Link**
3. Paste this URL:
   ```
   https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/45172601/2sB34ZrjUb
   ```
4. Click **Continue** → **Import**
5. Test all endpoints by running the collection.

## Example Request Body (POST or PUT)

```json
{
  "firstName": "Charles",
  "lastName": "Demo",
  "email": "charles@demo.com",
  "age": 10
}
```

---

## Assumptions & Design Decisions

- **Email field must be unique**: A student cannot be created with an email already in use.
- **Validation**: All fields are required. Age must be a number.
- **No Authentication**: This is a public API for demonstration purposes.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized HTTP status codes and error messages returned.
- **MongoDB**: Expected to run locally at `localhost:27017`.

```json
{
  "message": "A new student record has been created",
  "data": {

    "firstName": "Charles",
    "lastName": "Demo",
    "email": "charles@demo.com",
    "age": 10,
    "createdAt": "2025-07-01T16:29:14.088Z",
